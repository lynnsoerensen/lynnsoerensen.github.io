I am passionate about questions such as:</p> <ul> <li> <em>How</em> do we perceive objects in a world in constant flux?</li> <li> <em>How</em> do our brains deal with a dynamic visual world during object recognition?</li> <li> <em>How</em> does our experience with objects shape our brains and behavior?</li> </ul> <p>To answer these questions, I combine computational models (how?) with behavioral and neuroimaging experiments (what, where and when?).</p> <p>I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at MIT’s <a href="https://mcgovern.mit.edu/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">McGovern Institute for Brain Research</a> in <a href="https://dicarlolab.mit.edu/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Prof. James DiCarlo’s group</a>. My work is funded by a DFG Walter-Benjamin Fellowship.</p> <p>In my PhD research at the University of Amsterdam, I integrated concepts and methods from Psychology, Neuroscience and Artificial Intelligence to better understand different forms of cognitive modulation such as selective attention, arousal and past sensory states and their effects on visual processing in the brain. I was advised by Dr. H. Steven Scholte, Prof. Sander Bohté and Prof. Heleen Slagter.</p> </body></html>
