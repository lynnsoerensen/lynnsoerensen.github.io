I am a Cognitive Computational Neuroscientist with a fascination for how our brains make sense of the visual world. 
I am passionate about questions such as: 
- *How* do we perceive objects in a world in constant flux? 
- *How* do our brains deal with a dynamic visual world during object recognition? 
- *How* does our experience with objects shape our brains and behavior?

To answer these questions, I combine computational modeling with behavioral and neuroimaging experiments.

I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at MIT's [McGovern Institute for Brain Research](https://mcgovern.mit.edu/) in [Prof. James DiCarlo's group](https://dicarlolab.mit.edu/).
My work is funded by a DFG Walter-Benjamin Fellowship.

In my PhD research at the University of Amsterdam, I integrated concepts and methods from Psychology, Neuroscience and Artificial Intelligence to better understand different forms of cognitive modulation such as selective attention, arousal and past sensory states and their effects on visual processing in the brain. I was advised by Dr. H. Steven Scholte, Prof. Sander Boht√© and Prof. Heleen Slagter.
